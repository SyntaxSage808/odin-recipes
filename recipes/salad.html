    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This millionaire cheesecake salad is a fun spring treat, a dessert salad
    that is perfectly balancedâ€”sweet and nutty, with a subtle tang from the canned fruit,
    all folded into a creamy, airy, cream cheese mixture.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz of cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of confectioner's sugar</li>
        <li>0.5 cups of French vanilla dairy creamer</li>
        <li>8 oz of frozen whipped topping</li>
        <li> 15 oz of canned mandarin oranges, drained</li>
        <li>20 oz of canned pineapple chunks in juice, drained</li>
        <li>15 oz of canned pear chunks, drained</li>
        <li>3 cups of miniature marshmallows</li>
        <li>16 oz of jar maraschino cherries, drained, halved and patted dry</li>
        <li>7 oz of package sweetened flaked coconut</li>
        <li>2 cups of chopped toasted pecans</li>
        <li>4 graham cracker sheets, broken into 0.5 inch pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until smooth and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in powdered sugar until incorporated and smooth. With beaters running, slowly drizzle in creamer until smooth and fully combined, about 1 minute total. Fold in whipped topping.</li>
        <li>Add oranges, pineapple, pears, marshmallows, cherries, coconut, and pecans to cream cheese mixture; fold until fully coated. Serve immediately or refrigerate until chilled, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Just before serving, sprinkle evenly with graham crackers.</li>
    </ol>
