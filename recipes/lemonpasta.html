    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Pasta and Chicken</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz of pasta</li>
        <li>2 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoons of salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
        <li>Minced parsley (to serve)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Lemon Cream Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion (finely minced)</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>0.5 cups of chicken stock</li>
        <li>0.5 cups of grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>0.5 cups of heavy cream</li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoons of salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Zest and juice from 2 lemons</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the package directions. Drain then return the pasta to the pot and toss with a little splash of olive oil.</li>
        <li>While the pasta water is heating, pound the chicken breasts with a mallet or rolling pin so that they are ½ inch thick. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken breasts for 5 minutes per side, reducing the heat if needed, until they are cooked through. Remove them from the pan and slice them into bite-sized pieces once cool enough to handle then add them to the pot with the cooked pasta.</li>
        <li>Make the lemon cream sauce in the same pan as you used for the chicken. Add the olive oil, onion, and garlic and cook for 3 minutes, until the onion is soft and transparent. Add the chicken stock and scrape the pan of any stuck-on bits. Add the parmesan, heavy cream, salt, and pepper and bring the pan to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2-3 minutes, or until it thickens slightly. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the lemon zest and juice.</li>
        <li>Pour the lemon cream sauce over the pasta and cooked chicken and toss to combine. Serve with a little parsley sprinkled over the top for color.</li>
    </ol>
